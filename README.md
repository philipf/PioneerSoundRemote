# PioneerSoundRemote
Simple remote to control the sound on a Pioneer A/V receiver

My A/V receiver's remote is starting to pack-up, especially the volume buttons that are used often are being worn out.
This simple Arduino project records and replays "Volume-up" and "Volume-down" commands by sending IR signals
